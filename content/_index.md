        Electronic Vouchers for
        Climate Smart Agriculture in Sierra Leone
      text: |
        <br>
        
        Enhancing **climate resilience** and **food security** through innovative e-voucher systems for agroforestry adoption. Our randomized control trial investigates how digital platforms can nudge farmers toward sustainable agricultural practices across Sierra Leone's farming communities.

        **Can e-vouchers enhance Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) adoption in Sierra Leone?**
        
        Our study addresses this critical question through a **randomized control trial (RCT)** involving **600 upland rice-farming households** across three provinces (North, East, and South) in Sierra Leone.
        
        **Key Research Components:**
        - Electronic voucher systems for agroforestry seedlings
        - CSA-related animation videos for uniform extension services
        - Willingness-to-pay analysis for sustainability assessment
        - Impact evaluation on technology adoption and food security

      subtitle: 'Climate Change and Food Security in Sierra Leone'
      text: |
        Agriculture contributes **over 50% of Sierra Leone's national output**, yet rice productivity falls below national consumption requirements due to:
        
        - **Degraded soils** and environmental challenges
        - **Erratic rainfall** affecting rainfed farming systems  
        - **Limited access to capital** constraining CSA adoption
        - **Climate change impacts** on agricultural productivity
        
        Despite government support through the **Feed Salone Strategy 2023-2028**, CSA adoption remains low while food insecurity persists.

      title: "Our Approach"
      subtitle: 'Three Pathways to Impact'
      text: |
        We hypothesize that e-vouchers can enhance CSA adoption through three key mechanisms:
        
        **1. Nudging Behavior** üì±  
        Stimulating demand for agroforestry seedlings through digital incentives
        
        **2. Reducing Transaction Costs** üí∞  
        Providing easy access to cash and resources in rural communities
        
        **3. Minimizing Risk Aversion** üõ°Ô∏è  
        Reducing uncertainties about timely access to production resources
